<h1><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Change Maker Goal</h1>
<p>For my Change Maker goal, I have decided to start a club at GIHS - Podcast Club. This was originally my <a href="risk.html">Risk Taker</a> goal.</p>
<p><i class="fas fa-microphone-alt"></i> <i class="fas fa-angle-double-right"></i> <i class="fas fa-mobile-alt"></i></p><!--<i class="fas fa-headphones-alt"></i>-->
<hr>
<h2 id="plan"><i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i> PLAN</h2>
<p>I have wanted to start a club since two years ago, and I have wanted to host a <i>podcast-making</i> club in particular since Februaryish last year.</p>
<p>My plan from the start was to go with a podcast host (decided to go with <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">Transistor</a> initially, but wasn't sure for a while and may eventally change to a self-run RSS feed) in making podcast club for Glenunga.</p>
<p>I didn't really have a plan, except for going to Student Life and seeing how it went from there.<br/>
However, I <i>did</i> eventually end up with three plans, of which only the last one worked:</p>
<ol>
<li>Working with the <strong>Glenunga Dispatch</strong>.</li>
<li>Working with <strong>Radio Glenunga</strong>.</li>
<li>Working as a <strong>standalone club</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason these groups to work with were chosen were because in order,</p>
<ol>
<li>They are a club about news (specifically GIHS's newspaper); that is what I want the podcast to be about.</li>
<li>They are a club about radio, makes sense to have a podcast section.</li>
<li>This was a fallback option if the other two didn't work out; they didn't.</li>
</ol>
<p>I still do not know why I wasn't able to work with the Glenunga Dispatch, but I wasn't able to work with Radio Glenunga because when I asked to possibly start a podcast, their club was... dead-ish.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="goal"><i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i> Goal</h2>
<p><b>Criteria:</b> Hold first Club Meeting, have at least 1 episode published.</p>
<p><b>Completed:</b> First episode published Fri 22/05, First meeting not held by PLP folio due date, but held on 31/07.</p>
<p>The SACE capabilities that I am going to develop alongside this goal are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information and Communications Technology<!--(It is a podcast, and it will involve putting it online. I am also thinking about eventually switching to self-run RSS)--></li>
<li>Critical and Creative Thinking<!--(I obviously don't want the podcast to be bland)--></li>
<li>Personal and Social<!--(It is also a club, therefore I will have to communicate with others to set up and run it)--></li>
</ul>
<h3><i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> Information and Communications Technology</h3>
<p>The opportunities that I will have to develop this capability is:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that I have to put the podcast online so that people can listen to it
<ul><li>I will compare different plans for podcast hosting, and add tags and so on to podcast episodes when uploading them. Both of these I have not done before.</li>
<li>I will also need to learn about what microphones to use, and so on.</li>
<li>I also will have the opportunity to find out how to create and edit a podcast.</li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h3><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Critical and Creative Thinking</h3>
<p>The opportunities that I will have to develop this capability is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing the script
<ul><li>I don't want the podcast being too bland, so I need Creativity to come up with new episode &amp; script ideas</li>
<li>I will need Critical Thinking to make sure my script makes sense and is relevant and engaging for students at my school.</li></ul></li>
<li>I will need Critical and Creative thinking when facing any challenges that I come across during this project, and to develop my solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><i class="fas fa-users"></i> Personal and Social</h3>
<p>The opportunities that I will have to develop this capability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that I am creating a club
<ul><li>This means that I will not only have to communicate with potential club members, but also with other people (e.g. Mr Mewett) who can assist in setting up and running the club.</li>
<li>I will need to be careful in how I choose to communicate information to these people, including being mindful of being as articulate as I can, and communication with them in a timely manner.</li>
<li>To get this project off the ground I will need to be mindful of working to the given timeframe.</li></ul></li>
<li>The fact that it is a podcast and so I may need to conduct interviews as part of it.
<ul><li>This will involve me interacting with the person being interviewed in a way that will get a successful interview as a result.</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="interaction"><i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i> PRIMARY INTERACTION</h2>
<p>This is an email interaction with Ms Bush from Student Life about starting Podcast Club, before I found out that I wasn't able to work with the Glenunga Dispatch.</p>
<div class="quote qn">Hi,
<br>I have recently had an idea for a club at Glenunga, Podcast Club.
<br>Basically in the club we would create a podcast about things that are happening around Glenunga at the moment, and release it to other students.
<br>I have thought about it and have decided that I would prefer it to be hosted on Friday lunchtimes, in the Music Wing.
<br>Would this be a good idea for a club, and if so, what would be my next step in setting it up?
<br>Thanks,
<br>From Nick L

<br>
<div class="quote">Hi Nick,
<br>Thank you for coming to me with your idea! We have actually had some students come to me about potentially running a school newspaper- how would you feel about collaborating with them and perhaps being the “podcast wing” of their newspaper? I only mention this because it is much easier for our staff if clubs work together rather than all running as separate entities. Have you spoken with any other students who are keen to help? Have you done any video/audio editing before?
<br>Warm regards,
<br>Helen
</div>
<br>
<div class="quote qn">Hi,
<br>I didn’t know about that idea, and yes, I think collaborating with them could work!
<br>Could you possibly put me in contact with the students you mentioned in your email so I could talk to them about this?
<br>Thanks,
<br>From Nick L
</div>
<br>
<div class="quote">Great!
<br>Are you free on Wednesday lunch time at all to come in to the Student Life office to discuss your ideas with them? They are coming here for a meeting during that time.
<br>Thanks!
<br>Helen
</div>
<br>
<div class="quote qn">Sure, I don’t usually do anything Wednesday lunchtime, so I’ll come down then.
<br>Thank you so much!
<br>From Nick L
</div>
<br>
<div class="quote qn">However, I don’t know where the Student Life office is…</div>
<br>
<div class="quote">It’s in the same room as the <span class="info" title="...">█████████</span>, in the <span class="info" title="...">███████</span> area. :)</div>
