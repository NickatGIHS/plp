<h1><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Future Self Goal</h1>
<p>As I started researching some career ideas near the end of Year 9, in this section I will describe the career that I have decided on and investigate its requirements.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dreamjob"><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Dream Job</h2>
<p>My first idea was that I wanted to pursue my love of coding, so I went to <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder" target="_blank">Adelaide Uni's Degree Finder</a> (and <a href="https://study.unisa.edu.au/" target="_blank">UniSA</a>'s, but I ended up deciding on Adelaide Uni) and found <span class="info" title="Guaranteed Entry Score (ATAR): 80"><a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/bengh_behsofts1.html" target="_blank">this Software Engineering degree</a></span> that I liked the sound of.
<br>Because I am aiming to get into that degree is, in part, why I decided to <a href="#thissite">present my PLP as a HTML website</a> rather than a Google Site. It is helping me practise my coding skills.
</p>
<p>From looking at the requirements for that degree, I worked backwards into Year 12 subjects, and found that I would have to do Year 12 Mathematical Methods and 12 Physics (both SACE).
<br>As I am doing Year 12 Maths Methods this year, I only needed to figure out <a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/Glenungaihs/glenunga-curriculum-guide-2020/full-view.html" target="_blank">my path</a> for Physics.
<br>To get into 12 Physics you need a B or better in 11 Physics 1 & 2, and to get into that you need a C or better in both 10 Pre-Senior Science (which is covered by <a href="https://gihs.sa.edu.au/specialist-programs/ignite/" target="blank">IGNITE</a>) and Specialist Physics (which I am doing next semester).
<br>That is why I chose those courses when I was selecting subjects back at the end of Year 9.
</p>
<p>I also took <a href="https://joboutlook.gov.au/CareerQuiz" target="_blank">this Career Quiz</a> to double-check that I have chosen the right pathway, and these were my results:</p>
<img src="images/career-quiz.PNG" alt="53% Analytical, 26% Enterprising, 13% Administrative, 6% Creative, 0% Helping, 0% Practical" style="width: 100%;">
<p>I feel that this quiz has confirmed that I am choosing the right pathway, as being a Software Engineer doesn't require much in the terms of the <span class="info" title="Helping – guiding, caring, teaching, and talking">Helping</span> or <span class="info" title="Practical – physically active, hands-on problems and solutions">Practical</span> areas, but does in the <span class="info" title="Analytical - ideas, thinking, and figuring things out">Analytical</span> area.</p>
<p>As for the job that I would like after that course, I initially thought I might want to work at somewhere like <a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google</a>. I found a site for looking for jobs there - <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs" target="_blank">Google Careers</a>.<br/>
There is of course the issue of the fact that there are no Google offices in Adelaide. So, I am tentative (and don't want to plan <i>too</i> far ahead).</p>
<p>However, I recently (21/06) thought that I <i>might</i> want to be a freelance website coder.<br/>
Of course that lead me to do some research. The general response for how much money I'd make was "however much you can get people to pay" - the comment by Brent Phillips on <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-much-can-you-make-as-a-freelance-website-maker" target="blank">this Quora question</a> also helped a lot.<br/></p>

<h2 id="thissite"><i class="far fa-file-code"></i> This Website</h2>
<p>To show the skills that I am developing for the future, I created this website for my PLP.<br/>
This website was coded, from scratch, by me (in HTML), partially to show my coding skills, and partially because it is a passion of mine.</p>
<p>In addition, the Silly Stik website for my <a href="risk.html">Risk Taker</a> goal is also coded by me, from scratch.</p></p>
<p>I may (in the future, when PLP is nearly over) take screenshots of my code, but for now, please <a href="https://github.com/NickatGIHS/plp" target="_blank">go here</a> to see it (for <i>this</i> website only).</p>

<div class="quote qn">Hi Mr Thomas,<br/>
Would you mind answering some questions about careers in coding for my PLP?<br/>
I have listed the questions below, and would really like to hear your thoughts on these.<br/>
If you are happy to answer them, could you have responses beck to me by Wednesday?<br/>
This will help me with my timeline.<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

Hi Nick,<br/>
<br/>
Questions:<br/>
<ul>
<li class="ql">What professions are you aware of that involve a lot of coding?</li>
Every single career you can think of can use some kind of coding.  Look back at <a target="_blank" class="ql" href="https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU">https://youtu.be/7Pq-S557XQU</a> or also <a target="_blank" class="ql" href="https://youtu.be/WSKi8HfcxEk">https://youtu.be/WSKi8HfcxEk</a>. &#128527;

<li class="ql">In what way would coding be used in said professions?</li>
That answer is only limited by your imagination… &#129327;
</ul>
