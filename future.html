<h1><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> Future Self Goal</h1>
<p>As I started researching this near the end of Year 9, then instead of investigating a certain pathway I will describe my ideas.</p>
<h2><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Dream Job</h2>
<!-- <p>My dream job would be to work as a Software Engineer (preferrably at Google).
<br>Thankfully, Google has a website just for looking for jobs there, <a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs" target="_blank">Google Careers</a>.
<br>But that was not where my original plan started.
</p> -->
<p>My first idea was that I wanted to pursue my love of coding, so I went to <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder" target="_blank">Adelaide Uni's Degree Finder</a> (and <a href="https://study.unisa.edu.au/" target="_blank">UniSA</a>'s, but I ended up deciding on Adelaide Uni) and found <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/bengh_behsofts1.html" target="_blank">this Software Engineering degree</a>.
<br>The <a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/study/undergraduate/how-to-apply/guaranteed-entry/" target="_blank">guaranteed entry score</a> (<span class="info" title="Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank">ATAR</span>) for that course is 80.
</p>
<p>From that degree, I worked backwards into Year 12 subjects, and found that I would have to do Year 12 Mathematical Methods and 12 Physics (both SACE).
<br>As I am doing Year 12 Maths Methods this year, I only needed to figure out <a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/Glenungaihs/glenunga-curriculum-guide-2020/full-view.html" target="_blank">my path</a> for Physics.
<br>To get into 12 Physics you need a B or better in 11 Physics 1 & 2, and to get into that you need a C or better in both 10 Pre-Senior Science (which is covered by <a href="https://gihs.sa.edu.au/specialist-programs/ignite/" target="blank">IGNITE</a>) and Specialist Physics (which I am doing next semester).
<br>That is why I chose those courses when I was selecting subjects back at the end of Year 9.
</p>
<p>I also recently took <a href="https://joboutlook.gov.au/CareerQuiz" target="_blank">this Career Quiz</a> to double-check that I have chosen the right pathway, and these were my results:</p>
<img src="images/career-quiz.PNG" alt="53% Analytical, 26% Enterprising, 13% Administrative, 6% Creative, 0% Helping, 0% Practical" style="width: 100%;">
<p>I feel that this quiz has confirmed that I am choosing the right pathway, as being a Software Engineer doesn't require much in the terms of the <span class="info" title="Helping – guiding, caring, teaching, and talking">Helping</span> or <span class="info" title="Practical – physically active, hands-on problems and solutions">Practical</span> areas, but does in the <span class="info" title="Analytical - ideas, thinking, and figuring things out">Analytical</span> area.</p>
<!--<p>As soon as I typed "Adelaide" into the location filter, I realised that Google does not have an office here in Adelaide, meaning that I would have to move to either Melbourne or Sydney to work there.</p>-->
