<p>This is the reflection on how well I did in my goals over the past semester.</p>

<h3>After a semester of attempting to reach your aspiration, how far did you get?</h3>
<p>The most I was able to do in the timeframe set for the folio was create the trailer episode and have everything <i>set up</i> for the club. I was not able to host the first meeting until Term 3.
If this seems like not much, that is not the case because the setting up of the club involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many emails to Student Life</li>
<li>Conferring with the Glenunga Dispatch (in person/via email) and Radio Glenunga (via Discord)</li>
<li>Deciding on a podcast host and setting up an account</li>
<li>Creating the trailer</li>
<li>Finding a supervisor for the club</li>
<li>Deciding on a room to host the club in</li>
</ul>
<h3>What were the main challenges faced along the way?</h3>
<p>The most obvious challenge in the creation of Podcast Club was that I was not able to be a subset of either the Glenunga Dispatch or Radio Glenunga.
Me attempting to join the Glenunga Dispatch took 27 days <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>Another major challenge was that I have never set up a club or a podcast before, and I am not much of a people person (hence why this goal was initially in <a href="#risk">Risk Taker</a>), so I had to overcome that as well.</p>
<h3>How did you progress in improving your chosen Capability/s?</h3>
<h4>Information and Communications Technology</h4>
<p>This is probably the least developed capability of this goal, as I did not have to do much in the way of much computer-related work, surprisingly.</p>
<p>Most of it was handled by either <a href="change.html#interaction">Student Life</a> or <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">transistor.fm</a> (the podcast host).</p>
<h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
<p>This goal was not developed much, but it was used a lot in creating and editing the trailer episode, and as I have never edited or recorded a podcast before, this was very new.</p>
<h4>Personal and Social</h4>
<p>This is almost certainly the Capability that I developed the most.</p>
<p>That is because I was really out of my comfort zone in creating a club (even more so than <a href="risk.html">Risk Taker</a>, arguably) and I am, as mentioned above, not a people person.
I don't think I would have started Podcast Club if not for this PLP Goal.</p>

<h3>After a semester of attempting to reach your aspiration, how far did you get?</h3>
<p>The goal that I set for myself was to create a website for a comic that me and my brother made and put it online. I did that <a href="risk.html#siteonline">on Tuesday the 23rd of June</a>.</p>
<p>However, I have not made any more comics since then, and thus the website has not needed to be updated</p>
