<h1><i class="fas fa-pen"></i> Reflection</h1>
<p>This is the reflection on how well I did in my goals over the past semester.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="introduction"><i class="fas fa-scroll"></i> Introduction</h2>
<p>I feel that I have progressed a lot with my PLP, especially in the Information &amp; Communications Technology Capability as that was a part of most of my goals.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="change"><i class="fas fa-users"></i> <a href="change.html">Change Maker</a> (Podcast Club)</h2>
<h3>After a semester of attempting to reach your aspiration, how far did you get?</h3>
<p>The most I was able to do in the timeframe set for the folio was create the trailer episode and have everything <i>set up</i> for the club. I was not able to host the first meeting until Term 3.
If this seems like not much, that is not the case because the setting up of the club involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many emails to Student Life</li>
<li>Conferring with the Glenunga Dispatch (in person/via email) and Radio Glenunga (via Discord)</li>
<li>Deciding on a podcast host and setting up an account</li>
<li>Creating the trailer</li>
<li>Finding a supervisor for the club</li>
<li>Deciding on a room to host the club in</li>
</ul>
<h3>What were the main challenges faced along the way?</h3>
<p>The most obvious challenge in the creation of Podcast Club was that I was not able to be a subset of either the Glenunga Dispatch or Radio Glenunga.
Me attempting to join the Glenunga Dispatch took 27 days <i>alone</i>.</p>
<p>Another major challenge was that I have never set up a club or a podcast before, and I am not much of a people person (hence why this goal was initially in <a href="#risk">Risk Taker</a>), so I had to overcome that as well.</p>
<h3>How did you progress in improving your chosen Capability/s?</h3>
<h4>Information and Communications Technology</h4>
<p>This is probably the least developed capability of this goal, as I did not have to do much in the way of much computer-related work, surprisingly.</p>
<p>Most of it was handled by either <a href="change.html#interaction">Student Life</a> or <a href="https://transistor.fm/" target="_blank">transistor.fm</a> (the podcast host).</p>
<h4>Critical and Creative Thinking</h4>
<p>This goal was not developed much, but it was used a lot in creating and editing the trailer episode, and as I have never edited or recorded a podcast before, this was very new.</p>
<h4>Personal and Social</h4>
<p>This is almost certainly the Capability that I developed the most.</p>
<p>That is because I was really out of my comfort zone in creating a club (even more so than <a href="risk.html">Risk Taker</a>, arguably) and I am, as mentioned above, not a people person.
I don't think I would have started Podcast Club if not for this PLP Goal.</p>

<h2 id="risk"><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <a href="risk.html">Risk Taker</a> (Silly Stik Site)</h2>
<h3>After a semester of attempting to reach your aspiration, how far did you get?</h3>
<p>The goal that I set for myself was to create a website for a comic that me and my brother made and put it online. I did that <a href="risk.html#siteonline">on Tuesday the 23rd of June</a>.</p>
<p>However, I have not made any more comics since then, and thus the website has not needed to be updated</p>
<h3>What were the main challenges faced along the way?</h3>
<p>There were actually not that many challenges along the way, but the closest thing to a challenge would be that I had to scan in almost every single Silly Stik comic that we have created, and put them in the site's files.</p>
<h3>How did you progress in improving your chosen Capability/s?</h3>
<h4>Information and Communications Technology</h4>
<p>As this was my first time creating a PHP website and putting it online, I feel that I have progressed a lot in this SACE Capability for this task.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="future"><i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> <a href="future.html">Future Self</a> (Software Engineer)</h2>
<h3>After a semester of attempting to reach your aspiration, how far did you get?</h3>
<p>As I have not done any proper <i>tasks</i> for my Future Self goal, I will define "reaching my aspiration" as creating this website and researching my dream job.</p>
<h4><i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> Dream Job</h4>
<p>I feel that I have sufficiently researched my dream job of being a Software Engineer, and have chosen subjects accordingly.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am currently doing Year 10 Specialist Physics, which I need a C or better in to progress to 11 Physics. I have selected those subjects for my next year timetable.</li>
<li>With Maths, I was initially going to be doing 11 Maths 3 &amp; 4 <i>as well as</i> 12 Maths Methods, but we did not pick up that it was not on my timetable until the second semester. This means that instead of doing Year 12 Maths Specialist this year (which while it is over what is required to become a software endgineer I still wish to do it), I will be doing 11 Maths 3 &amp; 4 next year and 12 Specialist the year after.</li>
</ul>
<h4><i class="far fa-file-code"></i> This Website</h4>
<p>(work here)</p>
<h3>What were the main challenges faced along the way?</h3>
<p>There were not many challenges involved with creating a website or researching a career, except for the fact that coding a website from scratch is a bit harder than just creating a Google Site.</p>
<h3>How did you progress in improving your chosen Capability/s?</h3>
<h4>Information and Communications Technology</h4>
<p>I feel that this has been improved quite a bit, but not as mush as my <a href="#risk">Risk Taker</a> goal, as setting up a website on GitHub Pages is easier than via a web host.</p>
