&lt;h1>&lt;i class="fas fa-user-graduate">&lt;/i> Future Self Goal&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>As I started researching some career ideas near the end of Year 9, in this section I will describe the career that I have decided on and investigate its requirements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dreamjob">&lt;i class="fas fa-laptop-code">&lt;/i> Dream Job&lt;/h2>
&lt;!-- &lt;p>My dream job would be to work as a Software Engineer (preferrably at Google).
&lt;br>Thankfully, Google has a website just for looking for jobs there, &lt;a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs" target="_blank">Google Careers&lt;/a>.
&lt;br>But that was not where my original plan started.
&lt;/p> -->
&lt;p>My first idea was that I wanted to pursue my love of coding, so I went to &lt;a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder" target="_blank">Adelaide Uni's Degree Finder&lt;/a> (and &lt;a href="https://study.unisa.edu.au/" target="_blank">UniSA&lt;/a>'s, but I ended up deciding on Adelaide Uni) and found &lt;span class="info" title="Guaranteed Entry Score (ATAR): 80">&lt;a href="https://www.adelaide.edu.au/degree-finder/bengh_behsofts1.html" target="_blank">this Software Engineering degree&lt;/a>&lt;/span> that I liked the sound of.
&lt;br>Because I am aiming to get into that degree is, in part, why I decided to &lt;a href="#bonus">present my PLP as a HTML &lt;/a> rather than a Google Site. It is helping me practise my coding skills.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From looking at the requirements for that degree, I worked backwards into Year 12 subjects, and found that I would have to do Year 12 Mathematical Methods and 12 Physics (both SACE).
&lt;br>As I am doing Year 12 Maths Methods this year, I only needed to figure out &lt;a href="https://www.flipsnack.com/Glenungaihs/glenunga-curriculum-guide-2020/full-view.html" target="_blank">my path&lt;/a> for Physics.
&lt;br>To get into 12 Physics you need a B or better in 11 Physics 1 & 2, and to get into that you need a C or better in both 10 Pre-Senior Science (which is covered by &lt;a href="https://gihs.sa.edu.au/specialist-programs/ignite/" target="blank">IGNITE&lt;/a>) and Specialist Physics (which I am doing next semester).
&lt;br>That is why I chose those courses when I was selecting subjects back at the end of Year 9.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also recently took &lt;a href="https://joboutlook.gov.au/CareerQuiz" target="_blank">this Career Quiz&lt;/a> to double-check that I have chosen the right pathway, and these were my results:&lt;/p>
&lt;img src="images/career-quiz.PNG" alt="53% Analytical, 26% Enterprising, 13% Administrative, 6% Creative, 0% Helping, 0% Practical" style="width: 100%;">
&lt;p>I feel that this quiz has confirmed that I am choosing the right pathway, as being a Software Engineer doesn't require much in the terms of the &lt;span class="info" title="Helping – guiding, caring, teaching, and talking">Helping&lt;/span> or &lt;span class="info" title="Practical – physically active, hands-on problems and solutions">Practical&lt;/span> areas, but does in the &lt;span class="info" title="Analytical - ideas, thinking, and figuring things out">Analytical&lt;/span> area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for the job that I would like after that course, I decided on working at &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google&lt;/a>. Thankfully, Google has a site just for what I am doing, &lt;a href="https://careers.google.com/jobs" target="_blank">Google Careers&lt;/a>.
&lt;br>
&lt;/p>
&lt;!--&lt;p>As soon as I typed "Adelaide" into the location filter, I realised that Google does not have an office here in Adelaide, meaning that I would have to move to either Melbourne or Sydney to work there.&lt;/p>-->

&lt;p>Here's a secret: if you type "/bts" &lt;i>before the last slash in &lt;b>any&lt;/b> page on this website&lt;/i>, you will see all the code I wrote for it.&lt;/p>
