<h1><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Risk Taker Goal</h1>
<p>For my Risk Taker goal, I have decided to make a website for a comic that I started when I was younger, Silly Stik.<br/>
The site will be coded from scratch by me, in PHP (a <i>Hypertext Preprocessor</i> which is basically HTML with more features).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="plan"><i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i> PLAN</h2>
<p>I have been toying with the idea of creating a website for Silly Stik for a while now. I think that doing this for PLP has helped me feel like I can do it.</p>
<p>I, like with my <a href="change.html">Change Maker</a> goal, really just went into this without much of a plan. Once again, I just went with things as they came.</p>
<h3>Some notes about the site format</h3>
<p>At the start, I decided that ideally for the backend of the website, I would only have to add a file or two (the comic and data for the comic), and the website would add it automatically, as shown in this quick drawing.</p>
<img src="images/stiksite.png" width="50%">
<p>I feel like I should also mention that the site format will probably be loosely based off <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank">xkcd</a>'s website.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="goal"><i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i> Goal</h2>
<p><b>Criteria:</b> Have site online.</p>
<p><b>Completed:</b> Site put online 23/06/20</p>
<p>The SACE capability that I am going to develop alongside this goal is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information and Communications Technology</li>
</ul>
<h3><i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> Information and Communications Technology</h3>
<p>This is a task that heavily revolves around Information and Communication Technology.<br/>
The opportunities that I will have to develop this capability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that I need to <i>code</i> the website
<ul><li>This will help me because this is the first website that I have ever coded in PHP. I am familiar with HTML, but PHP is relatively new for me.</ul></li></li>
<li>The fact that I need to find &amp; buy a website hosting plan that suites me and this task
<ul><li>This will help me because I have never put a site online via a <i>proper</i> web host (GitHub Pages, which is what <i>this</i> site is hosted on, doesn't count as it does not come with a custom domain) before.</ul></li></li>
</ul>

<p class="prog">The Silly Stik Website required long lines of code to be written, and hours of research to learn new techniques to make my site function in the way I wanted.</p>
<p class="prog">This project has stretched me mentally with regard to problem solving skills and the patience I have needed to persist with challenges.<br/>
I am really proud of this achievement, and am proud to share it with others.</p>

<h2 id="interaction"><i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i> PRIMARY INTERACTION</h2>
<p>This is an email interaction with my brother, the co-creator of Silly Stik</p>
<div class="quote qn">Hi Sam,
<br/>I have some questions for you about the Silly Stik Website (<a href="http://sillystik.com/" target="_blank">http://sillystik.com/</a>).
<br/>I would appreciate you please having a look at the site and taking the time to answer the following questions.
<br/><b>QUESTIONS:</b>
<br/>As the co-creator of Silly Stik...
<ul><li>What are your impressions of seeing Silly Stik as a webcomic?</li>
<li>What current features do you like about the site?</li>
<li>What features don't you like about the site?</li>
<li>What improvements would you suggest for the site?</li>
<li>Do you think that the site should be kept running for more than a year (the current paid term is a year)? Why/why not?</li>
<li>Is there anything else you'd like to say about the site?</li></ul>
Thanks,
<br/>From Nick L

<div class="quote"><b>What are my impressions of seeing Silly Stik as a webcomic?</b>
<br/>I think that it is great that we have the opportunity to share these comics that we created as small children to the world, and have a place where we can see them all at once.
<br/><b>What current features of the website do I like?</b>
<br/>I like the gallery and the easy navigation as they help with getting around and make the experience much better. Also, the mouseover text is often amusing and a nice touch.
<br/><b>What features don't I like about the website?</b>
<br/>I really love the layout and structure of the website, and I don't dislike anything about it. Apart from my MS paint self portrait on the about page, of course. I can never seem to get it just right...
<br/><b>What improvements do I suggest for the website?</b>
<br/>If there is one improvement I would suggest, it would be moving some of the text on the homepage to the about page. Apart from that, I really like it and the website is great!
<br/><b>Do I think that the website should be kept running after the year's paid-term?</b>
<br/>I think it should be kept running, both to keep these in an accessible archive and in case we make any more and want to upload them.
<br/><b>Is there anything I would like to say about the site?</b>
<br/>Not really. I have pretty much said everything I wanted to say in the above questions. I really do like the website, though!
</div>
<p>One final note; as Sam has mentioned, he would like to keep the site running for more than the year we have paid for.</p>
<p>A solution to this is migrating the site from HostPapa to GitHub Pages, and changing the PHP code to Javascript. This is a project for the future, but if you wish to access the Silly Stik Site in 2021 or later and <a href="http://sillystik.com/" target="_blank">sillystik.com</a> does not work, try <a target="_blank" href="https://silly-stik.github.io">silly-stik.github.io</a>.</p>
