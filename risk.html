<h1><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Risk Taker Goal</h1>
<p>For my Risk Taker goal, I have decided to make a website for a comic that I started when I was younger, Silly Stik.<br/>
The site will be coded from scratch by me, in PHP (a <i>Hypertext Preprocessor</i> which is basically HTML with more features).</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="plan"><i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i> PLAN</h2>
<p>I have been toying with the idea of creating a website for Silly Stik for a while now. I think that doing this for PLP has helped me feel like I can do it.</p>
<p>I, like with my <a href="change.html">Change Maker</a> goal, really just went into this without much of a plan. Ince again, I just went with things as they came.</p>
<h3>Some notes about the site format</h3>
<p>At the start, I decided that ideally for the backend of the website, I would only have to add a file or two (the comic and data for the comic), and the website would add it automatically, as shown in this quick drawing.</p>
<img src="images/stiksite.png" width="50%">
<p>I feel like I should also mention that the site format will probably be loosely based off <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank">xkcd</a>'s website.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="goal"><i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i> Goal</h2>
<p><b>Criteria:</b> Have site online.</p>
<p><b>Completed:</b> Site put online...</p>
<p>The SACE capability that I am going to develop alongside this goal is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information and Communication Technology</li>
</ul>
<h3><i class="fas fa-laptop"></i> Information and Communications Technology</h3>
<p>This is a task that heavily revolves around Information and Communication Technology.<br/>
The opportunities that I will have to develop this capability are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that I need to <i>code</i> the website
<ul><li>This will help me because this is the first website that I have ever coded in PHP. I am familiar with HTML, but PHP is relatively new for me.</ul></li></li>
<li>The fact that I need to find &amp; buy a website hosting plan that suites me and this task
<ul><li>This will help me because I have never put a site online via a web host (GitHub Pages, which is what <i>this</i> site is hosted on, doesn't count) before.</ul></li></li>
</ul>
