<h2><i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i> PRIMARY INTERACTION</h2>
<p>This is an email interaction with Ms Bush from Student Life about starting Podcast Club</p>
<div class="quote qn">Hi,
<br>I have recently had an idea for a club at Glenunga, Podcast Club.
<br>Basically in the club we would create a podcast about things that are happening around Glenunga at the moment, and release it to other students.
<br>I have thought about it and have decided that I would prefer it to be hosted on Friday lunchtimes, in the Music Wing.
<br>Would this be a good idea for a club, and if so, what would be my next step in setting it up?
<br>Thanks,
<br>From Nick L

<div class="quote">Hi Nick,
<br>Thank you for coming to me with your idea! We have actually had some students come to me about potentially running a school newspaper- how would you feel about collaborating with them and perhaps being the “podcast wing” of their newspaper? I only mention this because it is much easier for our staff if clubs work together rather than all running as separate entities. Have you spoken with any other students who are keen to help? Have you done any video/audio editing before?
<br>Warm regards,
<br>Helen

<br>
<div class="quote qn">Hi,
<br>I didn’t know about that idea, and yes, I think collaborating with them could work!
<br>Could you possibly put me in contact with the students you mentioned in your email so I could talk to them about this?
<br>Thanks,
<br>From Nick L
</div>
<br>
<div class="quote">Great!
<br>Are you free on Wednesday lunch time at all to come in to the Student Life office to discuss your ideas with them? They are coming here for a meeting during that time.
<br>Thanks!
<br>Helen
</div>
<br>
<div class="quote qn">Sure, I don’t usually do anything Wednesday lunchtime, so I’ll come down then.
<br>Thank you so much!
<br>From Nick L

<br>
<div class="quote qn">However, I don’t know where the Student Life office is…</div>
